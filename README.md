# Water Quality Prediction 

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It is being developed as part of a one-month **AICTE 4-Week Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025**.


## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, till now we have:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets


## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation



## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and 
- CL


## Internship Details

- **Internship Type**: AICTE Virtual Internship - Edunet Foundation
- **Sponsor**: Shell  
- **Duration**: June 2025 (4 weeks)  
- **Focus Area**: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning in Green Technology
